I"ü<p>The CX CAP Goal Team identified these <a href="https://www.performance.gov/improving-cx-governmentwide/">barriers</a> to CX adoption practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CX is too often not a priority for leadership and staff at all levels.</li>
  <li>Program implementers donâ€™t necessarily have a deep understanding of their customer or their needs.</li>
  <li>Frustrated employees wonâ€™t provide an exceptional experience for customers.</li>
  <li>Getting the right CX talent and services is hard.</li>
</ul>
