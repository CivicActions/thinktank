<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>Creating a Customer Experience Office (CXO) can be a great strategy, but it isn’t necessarily the best approach for every agency. A successful CXO requires a strong commitment to human-centered design (HCD) practices and burgeoning expertise at multiple levels of the organization. CoE consultants collaborate with stakeholders and cross-functional agency teams to identify strategies for building and leveraging a solid CX foundation.</p>

<h2 id="human-centered-design-tools-and-processes">Human-Centered Design Tools and Processes</h2>

<h3 id="description-1">Description</h3>

<p>Federal agencies historically take a system-centric approach for the development of digital systems. As a result, software is often hard to use and harder to evolve as requirements change. Human-centered design puts the well-defined needs of well-defined users at the center of digital development, vastly improving usability, minimizing training and optimizing the productivity and satisfaction of the people who depend on federal systems.</p>
