<p>“Customer experience is more than just customer service: it is an individual’s perception of all their interactions with an organization or brand,” says the U.S. General Services Administration’s <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-customer-experience">Office of Customer Experience</a>. “Good customer experiences are intentionally designed with people in mind.”</p>

<p><a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play2">Play 2</a> of the Digital Services Playbook says, “Address the whole experience, from start to finish,” emphasizing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We need to understand the different ways people will interact with our services, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on a phone, or in person. Every encounter — whether it’s online or offline — should move the user closer towards their goal.</p>

<p>From GSA’s Centers of Excellence <a href="https://coe.gsa.gov/2019/04/10/cx-update-8.html">“How Customer Experience (CX) Can Help Your Agency”</a> blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Here’s a core tenet of CX work in slogan form: “No unending research.” The goal of CX is to quickly—but thoroughly—define the customer problem so we can start prototyping solutions. Depending on the size of the challenge, the research phase could be a few days, weeks, or months. By using this iterative process, we can “fail early, fail often,” to build on what works and throw out what doesn’t. By doing so, we deploy working solutions that pass real-world testing—instead of creating gigantic solutions that take so long to build that they’re no longer suitable because the challenges have changed.</p>

  <p>“CX is a solution—CX isn’t the only solution. CX is a great way to get deeper customer insights, and plugs in nicely to other approaches for process improvement, including Six Sigma, lean process management, and Agile. No matter what additional methods you use, CX helps you translate customer insights into actions that create outstanding experiences for customers.”</p>

<p>And according to the U.S. federal government Customer Experience Cross Agency Priority Goal Team, CX provides a <a href="https://www.performance.gov/mapping-cx-journey/">holistic understanding of the customer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When working across government organizations, it is important to capture both the front stage experience (what customers see) and the backstage operations (what makes this experience possible).”</p>
