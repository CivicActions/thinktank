I"´<p>In September 1993, the Clinton administration issued <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12862.pdf">Executive Order 12862 - Setting Customer Service Standards</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to carry out the principles of the National Performance Review, the Federal Government must be customer-driven. The standard of quality for services provided to the public shall be: Customer service equal to the best in business. For the purposes of this order, ‚Äò‚Äòcustomer‚Äô‚Äô shall mean an individual or entity who is directly served by a department or agency. ‚Äò‚ÄòBest in business‚Äô‚Äô shall mean the highest quality of service delivered to customers by private organizations providing a comparable or analogous service.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>All executive departments and agencies (hereinafter referred to collectively as ‚Äò‚Äòagency‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äò‚Äòagencies‚Äô‚Äô) that provide significant services directly to the public shall provide those services in a manner that seeks to meet the customer service standard established herein and shall take the following actions:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) identify the customers who are, or should be, served by the agency;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing services;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) post service standards and measure results against them;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) benchmark customer service performance against the best in business;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(e) survey front-line employees on barriers to, and ideas for, matching the best in business;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(f) provide customers with choices in both the sources of service and the means of delivery;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(g) make information, services, and complaint systems easily accessible; and</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(h) provide means to address customer complaints.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In April 2011, the Obama administration issued <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-13571-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-custom">Executive Order 13571 - Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ with advances in technology and service delivery systems in other sectors, the public‚Äôs expectations of the Government have continued to rise. The Government must keep pace with and even exceed those expectations. Government must also address the need to improve its services, not only to individuals, but also to private and Governmental entities to which the agency directly provides significant services. Government managers must learn from what is working in the private sector and apply these best practices to deliver services better, faster, and at lower cost. Such best practices include increasingly popular lower-cost, self-service options accessed by the Internet or mobile phone and improved processes that deliver services faster and more responsively, reducing the overall need for customer inquiries and complaints. The Federal Government has a responsibility to streamline and make more efficient its service delivery to better serve the public.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In June 2018, the Office of Management and Budget issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s280.pdf">Circular A-11 Section 280 ‚Äì Managing Customer Experience and Service Delivery</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Implementing the guidance specified in this section will establish a more consistent, comprehensive, robust, and deliberate approach to CX across government.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The purpose of this guidance is to:</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Establish a CX-mindful culture across Federal Government services;</li>
  <li>Improve customer satisfaction with and trust in Federal Government;</li>
  <li>Provide structure and consistency around how agencies/programs approach CX;</li>
  <li>Promote program accountability and governance mechanisms to improve quality and service;</li>
  <li>Ensure high-impact  programs  are  making  progress  in  growing  CX  program  maturity, service  definition, and applying leading practices;</li>
  <li>Ensure high-impact programs are receiving and acting upon customer feedback to drive performance improvement and service recovery;</li>
  <li>Allow for government-wide comparative assessment of customer satisfaction; and</li>
  <li>Ensure transparency through public reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Signed into law in December 2018, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ336/PLAW-115publ336.pdf"> 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act</a>, known as 21st Century IDEA, requires federal government websites to ‚Äúimproves customer experience‚Äù through the use of ‚Äúqualitative and quantitative data obtained from across the executive agency relating to the experience and satisfaction of customers, identify areas of concern that need improvement and improve the delivery of customer service.‚Äù</p>
