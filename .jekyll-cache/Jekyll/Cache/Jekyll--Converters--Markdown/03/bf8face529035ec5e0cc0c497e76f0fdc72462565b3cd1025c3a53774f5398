<p>From White House Circular No.A-11 Section 280.2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the purposes of this guidance, “customers” are individuals, businesses, and organizations (such as grantees, state and municipal agencies) that interact with a Federal Government agency or program, either directly or via a Federal contractor or even a Federally-funded program. Federal government customers could also include public servants and employees themselves in their interactions with Federal processes.”</p>

<h2 id="customer-experience">‘Customer experience’</h2>

<p>According to the U.S. General Services Administration’s <a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/CX-Evaluation-and-Buying-Guide.pdf">Customer Experience Services Evaluation and Buying Guide</a>, “Customer Experience is an individual’s perception of their collective interactions with an organization or a brand.”</p>

<p>From White House Circular No.A-11 Section 280.3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Customer experience (CX) refers to a combination of factors that result from touchpoints between an individual, business, or organization and the Federal Government over the duration of an interaction and relationship. These factors can include ease/simplicity, efficiency/speed, and equity/transparency of the process, effectiveness/perceived value of the service itself, and the interaction with any employees. Similar to their application in the private sector, these factors can drive the overall satisfaction and confidence/trust with the program, agency, and the government at large.”</p>
