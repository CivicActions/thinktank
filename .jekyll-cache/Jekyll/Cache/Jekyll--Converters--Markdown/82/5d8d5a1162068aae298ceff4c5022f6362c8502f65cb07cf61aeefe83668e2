I"ø<p>The U.S. federal government has designated <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/overview/">Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals</a> specifically related to customer experience: <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/cx/">Improving Customer Experience with Federal Services</a></p>

<h2 id="goal-statement">Goal statement</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This goal will provide a modern, streamlined, and responsive customer experience across government, comparable to leading private-sector organizations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="barriers">Barriers</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Citizens and businesses expect well-designed, efficient government services that are generally comparable in quality to that of leading private-sector organizations. Despite some important strides to improve customer experience, many federal government services fail to meet the expectations of the public, creating unnecessary hassle and cost for citizens, businesses, and the government itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-opportunity">The opportunity</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are opportunities to: increase trust in the Federal Government by improving the experience citizens and businesses have with federal services across all delivery channels; transform the customer experience by improving the usability and reliability of our governmentâ€™s most critical digital services; and, create measurable improvements in customer satisfaction by using the principles and practices proven by leading private-sector organizations.</p>
