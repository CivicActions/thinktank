<h2 id="customer-first-mindset">Customer-first mindset</h2>

<p>The Federal Government is transforming how agencies improve service delivery by putting people at the center of those efforts. A new paradigm for this movement is considering the public as customers. Some agencies are developing how they do business to intentionally take on a customer-first mindset. In addition, new agendas and policies require agencies to measure and improve customer experience (CX). You may represent an agency that is already meeting those requirements and have a thorough understanding of your customers‚Äô journeys and needs. Alternatively, your agency may be just getting started, or you may simply be curious about the topic. This guide should be informative for all of these entry points.</p>

<p>Many businesses provide services that they claim are used to understand customer experiences and improve them. Some of these claims are reliable and some may not be. The purpose of this guide is to give evaluation recommendations to repre-sentatives of federal agencies as they shop amongst those providers. We provide a dual lens of what to seek and what to be cautious of. The guide orients to leading practices in industry and government, and the Office of Management and Budget‚Äôs (OMB) annual budget guidance as context for seeking Human-centered Design (HCD) services to understand and improve customer experience.</p>

<h2 id="cx-in-government">CX in government</h2>

<p>Customer Experience is an individual‚Äôs perception of their collective interactions with an organization or a brand. It‚Äôs not a new concept. As long as people have purchased goods or hired services, businesses and providers have sought to deliver quality experiences. Today, in the private sector, the most successful brands are highly attuned to customer needs and intentionally design experiences to meet and exceed those needs. The Federal Government is taking the cue. Agencies are looking differently at the public they serve. There is renewed at-tention on what people need from federal services. Furthermore, agencies are showing a commitment to identify service pain points so they can improve them for the customer.</p>

<p>The business of the Federal Government is to serve the American people.1 The President‚Äôs Management Agenda (PMA) is the Office of Management and Budget‚Äôs plan for how the govern-ment should transform to deliver on this promise. One of the goals of the PMA is to provide a modern, streamlined, and responsive customer experience across government that is comparable to leading private-sector organizations. The PMA identified 25 High-Impact Service Providers (HISPs) who have numerous and key interactions with taxpayers. These HISPs were tasked to create a CX plan for their program and strategize the best ways to help their customers. OMB, in its annual budget guidance, defined what is required of agencies in a new section titled: ‚ÄúManaging Customer Experience and Improving Service Delivery‚Äù.2</p>

<p>1 https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/
2 Office of Management and Budget, Circular A-11, Section 280. https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s280.pdf</p>

<p>There is a lot to interpret and understand in order to act on it. Many of the HISPs were new to CX and recognized a need for support in order to meet requirements. But there was no guidebook on how to do it. Agencies new to CX have asked fundamental questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who are our key customers in the CX framework?</li>
  <li>Which services or interactions should we focus on?</li>
  <li>What can and should we try to do in-house versus hiring staff or contractors to help with?</li>
  <li>What qualifications, skills, and experience are we looking for?</li>
  <li>What will they do when they get here?</li>
  <li>Where do we start?</li>
</ul>

<p>As federal agencies mature in their CX practices, the following CX Roadmap offers an overview and guidance on what agencies should consider as they buy CX services. This guide also provides more specific guidance around the procurement of HCD services, questions to ask, and other factors to look out for when reviewing vendor submissions.</p>

<h2 id="cx-roadmap">CX Roadmap</h2>

<h3 id="focus-on-a-persistent-customer-need">Focus on a persistent customer need.</h3>

<p>Focus will concentrate momentum. Work with leaders and existing data to identify an agreed-upon pain point, then leverage contracts to bring speed and expertise to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-an-inspiring-vision-for-change">Start with an inspiring vision for change.</h3>

<p>Look forward and think of the story you want to tell others after the initial priority work is done. Then look backward and build a plan to realize that vision.Think about how you will measure the impact of your CX efforts.Stretch beyond the status quo. Envision what this service could look like in 5 years and aim to do that in 1 year.</p>

<h3 id="identify-your-needs-and-ask-for-help">Identify your needs and ask for help.</h3>

<p>Find the people within and outside the organization whom you can partner with. The CX Cross Agency Priority Goal team and other agency CX professionals can help guide you through this process.Engage stakeholders as partners and co-creators versus clients or direct reports.Shape contractor relationships so they build the capacity of your program and agency (e.g., processes, training, templates, hiring guidance) while solving CX challenges.</p>

<h3 id="share-your-research-in-the-open">Share your research in the open.</h3>

<p>Start talking to customers to ensure that you‚Äôre solving the right problems for the right people.Share your insights relentlessly with customers. Always keep them in the loop and they will be your biggest advocates. Integrate periodic briefings to internal leaders within contracting agreements to share insights, choose pilots, and demonstrate results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do we have a consistent process in place for capturing and sharing lessons learned?</li>
  <li>Is our CX program improving based on lessons learned?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="principles-for-evaluating-cx-service-providers">Principles for evaluating CX service providers</h2>

<p>The rise in attention on CX in government has brought an influx of articles, reports, books, and guides, which vary in emphasis and orientation. Most include putting the customer at the center of service evaluation and improvement. For this guide, we‚Äôve surfaced five CX principles pertinent to evaluating service providers.</p>

<p>The evaluation criteria shared in this guide is synthesized from 108 responses to a Request for Information (RFI) completed by businesses on their capabilities to provide HCD services in the context of CX. GSA‚Äôs Office of Customer Experience (OCE) initiated the RFI, reviewed the responses, and authored this guide. If you‚Äôre more interested in the RFI and how OCE conducted the study, please skip to page 9.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre new to this approach, you may wonder what Human- centered Design has to do with customer experience. HCD is a method that service providers use to understand real customer needs and to design or improve service delivery based on that understanding. A firm may not use the term HCD; however, CX work will always center on the customer from start to finish.</p>

<h3 id="5-cx-principles">5 CX principles</h3>

<p>The firms which you consider should be able to address each of these principles in their case studies and responses.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with empathy for the customer</li>
  <li>Use HCD practices to understand customer journeys and needs</li>
  <li>Involve customers in service design improvements</li>
  <li>Create, test, and refine ideas and solutions</li>
  <li>Measure efforts against outcomes that point to tangible improvements in customer experience</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="evaluation-criteria-of-industry-partners">Evaluation criteria of industry partners</h2>

</ul>

<h4 id="shortlist-of-responsibilities">Shortlist of responsibilities</h4>

<p>Sample evaluation criteria for full-time staff or contract support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead and manage complex projects from discovery and design to technical develop-ment and implementation</li>
  <li>Utilize HCD methods, tools, and approaches, such as: design thinking, service design, content design, product design, behavioral science, ethnographic research, usability research, or accessibility assessment</li>
  <li>Develop research plans with an understanding of how disparate systems function and change over time with multiple user groups</li>
  <li>Execute research that helps programs better understand stakeholder needs to inform improvements to products, services, policies, and processes</li>
  <li>Produce user needs specs. &amp; experience goals, personas, journey maps, storyboards, scenarios, flowcharts, and design prototypes</li>
  <li>Make findings relevant and impactful for design and action through a variety of formats such as insights, stories, videos, experiences and exhibits</li>
  <li>Design product and service ideas with low and high fidelity mockups using methods like sketching, wireframing, and/or prototyping</li>

<h4 id="what-to-be-cautious-of">What to be cautious of</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of specificity and quality of the response overall, such as generic sales pitches</li>
  <li>Long list of certifications that are not relevant to your requirements * Heavy on methods, services, and details about the firm while lightly covering case study details</li>
  <li>Emphasis on the design and deployment of complex technology solutions; may look like narrow focus on digital tools or touchpoints</li>
  <li>Lack of understanding of the differences between HCD, Agile, and Lean methodologies. For example, a vendor may describe a client project that followed the steps of an Agile development process as a sample of their HCD experience. Moreover, scout for businesses that deliber-ately mislabel or mischaracterize work to fit RFI criteria</li>
  <li>Pitching a pre-packaged solution vs. a tailored approach that is based on client‚Äôs real customer needs</li>
  <li>Insufficient explanation of root cause analysis, customer understanding, and problem/opportunity framing</li>
  <li>Lack of relevant experience, examples, or evidence to demonstrate fluency with subject matter or ability to perform HCD work in service of CX projects</li>
  <li>Within a case study or project, there is no clear indication of how the firm‚Äôs work has contributed to a measurable outcome</li>
  <li>Length of HCD projects: they typically are short term (weeks to months). Be skeptical of open-ended mainte-nance projects that last for years, without defined goals</li>
  <li>Lack of demonstrated competence in assessing and measuring customer experience</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="questions-for-framing-cx-efforts-and-hcd-services-acquisition">Questions for framing CX efforts and HCD services acquisition</h2>

<p>In building a plan for acquiring HCD support services, there are a number of questions you‚Äôll want to address, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What support services do you need, e.g., initial discovery research, customer journey mapping, service design, establishing CX measures, CX capacity building?</li>
  <li>Are there specific CX challenges and opportunities that you want to take on?</li>
  <li>How might you leverage existing resources?</li>
  <li>What are your options (beyond working with the existing resources)?* Have you engaged with key stakeholders in evaluating your options?</li>
  <li>What is the estimated cost/level of effort and benefits for each option?* What work should remain in-house vs. what should be contracted?</li>
  <li>How will you measure success?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-might-you-engage-with-vendors">How might you engage with vendors</h2>

<h2 id="the-rfi">The RFI</h2>

<p>GSA‚Äôs Office of Customer Experience (OCE) is the first agency-wide organization to focus solely on improving customer experience and fostering a customer-first mentality. The team  assisted with many CX efforts under the PMA. In seeing that many HISPs don‚Äôt have in-house expertise to perform HCD methods, OCE wanted to make it easier for them to find partners outside of the government. OCE sent a Request for Information (RFI) to industry using GSA‚Äôs Market Research as a Service. The intent of the RFI was to provide HISPs and the rest of the government a base from which to start their search for partnerships.</p>

<p>The RFI asked firms to provide the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Currently held government contracts</li>
  <li>NAICS code</li>
  <li>Business size</li>
  <li>Socio-economic category</li>
</ul>

<p>The RFI also asked respondents to answer questions on whether they had relevant experience providing certain types of services listed in the five domains of OMB‚Äôs Circular A11, Section 280, Managing Customer Experience and Improving Service Delivery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measurement</li>
  <li>Governance</li>
  <li>Organization &amp; Culture</li>
  <li>Customer Research</li>
  <li>Service Design</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, the RFI asked respondents to share a CX project with a medium to large client that spans the full-range from discovery to design to measurement. The RFI required them to submit one to three examples and to limit their submission to three pages. Of note for the reader, the following data includes vendors who currently offer HCD and CX services through GSA contracts and some who currently do not.</p>

<h3 id="data-on-rfi-responses">Data on RFI responses</h3>

<p>OCE received a total of 108 submissions. The following are the small-business designations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>74 identifying as small-business</li>
  <li>11 8(a)</li>
  <li>10 Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB)</li>
  <li>8 Small Disadvantaged Business</li>
  <li>6 HubZone</li>
  <li>6 Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned</li>
  <li>6 Woman-Owned Business</li>
  <li>4 Economically Disadvantaged WOSB</li>
  <li>4 Veteran Owned Small Business</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the number of respondents who held government contracts through GSA:</p>

<ul>
  <li>76 Schedule 70</li>
  <li>40 00CORP</li>
  <li>14 Stars 2</li>
  <li>11 OASIS Unrestricted</li>
  <li>10 Alliant 2</li>
  <li>1 OASIS Small Business</li>
  <li>34 Other GSA Contracts</li>
  <li>8 No GSA contract</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-an-rfi-in-government">What is an RFI in government?</h3>

<p>A Request for Information (RFI) is a step in a procurement process that allows the government to gather information from service providers and stakeholders to define the goals toward a desired result. This is a collab-orative step, one that creates a shared vision for success and leads to a more effective Request for Proposals. 1</p>
