The CX CAP Goal Team identified these [barriers](https://www.performance.gov/improving-cx-governmentwide/) to CX adoption practices:



*   CX is too often not a priority for leadership and staff at all levels.
*   Program implementers don’t necessarily have a deep understanding of their customer or their needs.
*   Frustrated employees won’t provide an exceptional experience for customers.
*   Getting the right CX talent and services is hard.
