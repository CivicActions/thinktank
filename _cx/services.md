## CX Strategy

###  Description

Creating a Customer Experience Office (CXO) can be a great strategy, but it isn’t necessarily the best approach for every agency. A successful CXO requires a strong commitment to human-centered design (HCD) practices and burgeoning expertise at multiple levels of the organization. CoE consultants collaborate with stakeholders and cross-functional agency teams to identify strategies for building and leveraging a solid CX foundation.

###  Sample deliverables

*   Agency Customer Audits
*   Cross-Functional Workshops
*   Customer and Service Analysis
*   CX Capability Road Maps
*   Customer Engagement Strategies
*   Staffing Plans
*   Candidate Evaluations
*   Communication Plans for Stakeholders, Congress and the Public

##  Human-Centered Design Tools and Processes

###  Description

Federal agencies historically take a system-centric approach for the development of digital systems. As a result, software is often hard to use and harder to evolve as requirements change. Human-centered design puts the well-defined needs of well-defined users at the center of digital development, vastly improving usability, minimizing training and optimizing the productivity and satisfaction of the people who depend on federal systems.

###  Sample deliverables

*   Design Workshops
*   Co-Design Sessions
*   Interview Guides
*   Personas
*   Wireframes
*   Interaction Patterns
*   Prototypes
*   Testing scripts
*   Design Systems

*   Customer and Stakeholder Interviews
*   Contextual Inquiry
*   Personas
*   Engagement Models
*   Research Reports

##  Service Design

###  Description


People don’t use digital systems in a vacuum. Fully addressing the needs of customers requires solutions that cross physical and digital channels. Service design is an approach to defining and solving complex problems that takes into account all aspects of the interactions between agencies and their customers. 


###  Sample deliverables

*   Cross-Functional Workshops
*   Storyboards
*   Journey Maps
*   Service Blueprints

Any agency can implement available tools for collecting feedback from customers, but only agencies that have fully committed to HCD practices have the foundation necessary to truly leverage customer insights to make data-driven decisions.


###  Sample deliverables

*   Contact Center Process Optimization and Tool Improvements
*   Knowledge Management Acquisitions
